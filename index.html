The system guarantees a user-friendly interface, safe transactions, and real-time availability. I contributed to the team's efforts to improve the frontend experience and make user navigation smooth. My abilities in full-stack programming, API integration, and managing real-time data were enhanced by this project. Working together to solve problems and develop a dependable and expandable booking system was a terrific experience.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Developing a Hotel Management System was my first team project. We used PostgreSQL for data management and Python Django for the backend to build a strong platform. For collaboration and version control, we used Git. I focused on the user interface, making sure it was easy to use and gave clients a smooth way to make bookings, book rooms, and find services. I was able to obtain hands-on experience in frontend development, UI/UX design, and cooperation through this project. It was a priceless educational experience that expanded my knowledge of teamwork and full-stack programming.

                  <p class="card-text">It was a collaborative effort where my team and I built a platform to streamline hiring for companies and job searches for students. We made sure everything ran well by using MySQL for database administration and Spring Boot for the backend. I worked mostly as a recruiter, creating features for job advertisements, handling applications, and setting up interviews. A student dashboard for monitoring the status of applications and interviews was also part of the system. Efficiency, security, and an intuitive user interface were our top priorities. My abilities in full-stack programming, collaboration, and problem-solving in a practical hiring situation were enhanced by this project.</p>
